Deliberation Simulation:

Models mental competition between options
Simulates activation/inhibition dynamics
Accounts for personal slack tolerance
Considers contextual influences

Output Generation:

Alternative options with pros/cons
Explicit explanation of decision process
Predicted satisfaction level

Transparency and Explainability
Glass-Box Decision Making
Example Explanation:
Recommendation: Take the bike

Why this recommendation:
- Your biospheric values (8/10) strongly favor cycling
- Weather is favorable (sunny, 18°C, low wind)
- Current traffic is heavy (UC3 simulation shows 15min car delay)
- Your typical bike travel time: 22 minutes
- Car would take approximately 25 minutes today
- You usually bike in these conditions (85% historical rate)

Alternative: Public Transport
- Slightly slower (28 minutes total with walking)
- Would better match your comfort preference in rain
- Lower stress than driving in current traffic

Why not car:
- Traffic congestion contradicts your time-efficiency priority
- Conflicts with your environmental values
- Your personal slack (6/10) wouldn't comfortably justify this choice
